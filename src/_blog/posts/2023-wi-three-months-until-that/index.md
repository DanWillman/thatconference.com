title: 3 months until THAT Conference

Right now, it's 3 am, and I can't get THAT Conference off my mind. That might be the worst email opening line ever, but it's true and dark outside.

But seriously, I can't stop thinking about THAT. I woke up, grabbed my laptop, and started writing.

I have one goal; foster the best community of geeks and geeklings on this planet, both online and in person. THAT Conference is without question the only conference that is also a community, and it's because of people like you.

The past four events we've held in both Texas and Wisconsin have been very special, not because of the shirts, the bbq, the walking tacos ( they were fire, actually not literally on fire, never mind), or even my silly tomfoolery, but because of the people who came and what they did. Let me say that again, the people, YOU!

Why is it so different now, Clark?

The pandemic altered our (the collective, and well, ours too) course. The course of what? Well, it depends on who you are. In some areas of life, we got complacent, while in others areas, they were yet to be explored. If I'm being positive Panda, we can all agree it dropped a big ole bag of change on our doorsteps.

Regardless, after the past four events now in two different states, I can say this:

We need each other more than most care to admit.
Friendships and networks become cemented when people are together.
Online !== In Person
Life continues.
But, bUt, BUUT, what is lovely and maybe even the most important, the conversations now in person are far deeper than ever before. That right there is what THAT is all about. Yes, we come to learn from other practitioners, but we grow as a family when we bond. This isn't to say I don't believe online doesn't have a place, far from it. We're building THAT.us for precisely that, but neither can replace the other.

And yet, here we are, 13 years and a global pandemic later, we still haven't given up. The tech might be different, HDMI is now the standard, and once again, in less than three months, I'll take the stage with butterflies in my stomach and say Good Morning, Campers.

I am beyond excited to have that opportunity and hope to see you there.

Come for the learning, and stay for the community.

Clark
