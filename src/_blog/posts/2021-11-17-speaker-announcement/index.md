Without question, one of the most challenging milestones for us is picking counselors. No matter where we all call home, there are wonderful awesome folks passionate about sharing their knowledge and hardships to help others be one tick better. On behalf of everyone who has ever consumed someone else's knowledge, Thank You.

### We need your help.

On a more serious note, we need your help. Would you mind telling your fellow geeks and companies about THAT? Like you, we're slinging tech all day, not marketing. We're focused on you. Our marketing comes from all of you telling others about THAT with open arms. We're grateful to be surrounded by so many generous people, and we're passionate about the community. You might not think a little social post or telling someone is a big deal, but it is.
