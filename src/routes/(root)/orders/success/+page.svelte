					land there accidentally.</span>

				<h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>Based on your purchase we have some follow-ups for you.</p>
				<h4>You're going to THAT Conference!</h4>

				{#if targetLocations.includes('AT')}
					<p>
						Time to get your travel and hotel rooms sorted. Head over to our travel page for hotel
						room blocks, addresses, and other details.
					</p>

					<div class="my-8 flex justify-center md:justify-end">
						{#if eventLocation.toUpperCase() === 'WI'}
							<StandardLink href="/support/travel/wi" target="_blank"
								>Book Your Travel To Wisconsin</StandardLink>
						{/if}
						{#if eventLocation.toUpperCase() === 'TX'}
							<StandardLink href="/support/travel/tx" target="_blank"
								>Book Your Travel To Texas</StandardLink>
						{/if}
					</div>

					<h4>Dietary Requirements and T-Shirts</h4>
					<p>
						Do you have dietary requirements? THAT Conference works with the Kalahari catering team
						to provide meals that encompass a variety of dietary choices. At every meal, we strive
						to provide gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options. Menus are posted daily and labels
						are displayed next to each food item to help you make the best decision based on your
						needs. If you have a severe dietary requirement, please email us at <a
							href="mailto:hello@that.us"
							target="_blank"
							class="hover">hello@that.us</a> so we can work together in finding the right solution to
						fit your needs.
					</p>
					<p>
						All Camper, Campmate and Geekling tickets include an official THAT t-shirt. During
						on-site registration, you can choose your desired shirt size. We order a wide range of
						sizes for each event. If for some reason, we run out of the size you’d like, we’ll send
						you one after the event!
					</p>
				{/if}

				{#if targetLocations.includes('ON')}
					<p>
						No further action is required for your <span class="font-extrabold">ON THAT</span> tickets.
						Ok, small lie there. You now have access to that event and are free to start adding to the
						schedule. That's correct; you can add sessions as well, and make sure to select the right
						event.
					</p>

					<div class="my-8 flex justify-center md:justify-end">
						<StandardLink href="https://that.us/activities/create" target="_blank"
							>Create an Activity</StandardLink>
					</div>
				{/if}
				{#if isBulkPurchase}
					<h4>Action Required – You have unallocated tickets</h4>
					<p>
						You've purchased multiple tickets, and those tickets need to be allocated (assigned) to
						someone. The process is easy. All you need to transfer a ticket is the
						<span class="font-bold">profile email address</span> of the person you are transferring
						the ticket to. We've put together the steps
						<a class="hover" href="/support/transfer-a-ticket" target="_blank"
							>in this handy guide</a>
						for your reference.
					</p>
					<p>
						Remember to allocate a ticket to <em>yourself</em> if <em>you're</em> attending!
					</p>
					{#if targetLocations.includes('AT')}
						<p>If any of the tickets are for a spouse or child, they don't need to be allocated.</p>
					{/if}

					<div class="my-8 flex justify-center md:justify-end">
						<StandardLink href="/my/settings/order-history" target="_blank"
							>Allocate Tickets Now</StandardLink>
					</div>
				{/if}

				<h4>Ticket Refunds</h4>
				<p>
					Ticket refunds will not be issued on any ticket <span class="font-bold">30 days</span> before
					the event or thereafter. Prior to that, a $30.00 (per ticket) processing fee will be applied
					to each Camper ticket refund and a $10.00 (per ticket) processing fee will be applied to each
					Geekling and Campmate ticket refund.
				</p>

				<h4>Meet THAT Camper</h4>
				<p>
					Say hello to Meet THAT Camper – your weekly chance to connect with a fellow geek before
					THAT Conference. Every Monday at 9 AM central, we'll introduce you to another attendee
					headed to the event. Getting started is easy, go to your
					<a class="hover" href="/my/notification-preferences" target="_blank"
						>notification preferences</a> and enable the Meet THAT Camper notification. It's that simple,
					and you can shut it off at any time. There are more details about Meet THAT Camper on the notification
					preferences page.
