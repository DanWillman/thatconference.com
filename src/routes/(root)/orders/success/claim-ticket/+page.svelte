	<p>Welcome to THAT Conference Online, we are excited to have you joining us.</p>

	<h2>Here are a few items to do next:</h2>

	<ol class="prose prose-lg">
		<li>
			<span class="font-bold"
				>Create or update your <a href="/my/profiles/public">public profile</a>.</span> If you have a
			public profile you'll be listed as an attendee on the event website. This is a great way for folks
			to to create a connection request with you.
		</li>

		<li>
			<span class="font-bold"
				>Create or update your <a href="/my/profiles/public">shared profile</a>.</span> Your shared profile
			is what will get shared when you choose to connect with someone.
		</li>

		<li>
			<span class="font-bold">View your <a href="/my/network">network</a>.</span> All this business about
			public and shared profiles is for a very good reason. It's to help you grow your network. As your
			network grows you can see your connections in our my network section.
		</li>

		<li>
			<span class="font-bold"
				>Enable <a href="/my/notification-preferences">Meet THAT Camper</a>.</span> Meeting people is
			hard, we get that. That's why we created Meet THAT Camper. Every monday morning we will do a randomized
			email introduction to another person also attending the upcoming event.
		</li>

		<li>
			<span class="font-bold">Join us in <a href="/my/profiles/primary">Slack or Discord</a>.</span>
			We have the chat channels too. Both our Slack or Discord channels are a great way to interact with
			folks all year round but you knew that already.
		</li>

		<li>
			<span class="font-bold"
				>Connect with our <a href="/online/tx/2024/sponsors">sponsors and partners</a>.</span> If you
			have a public profile you'll be listed as an attendee on the event website. This is a great way
			for folks to get in contact with you after the event.
		</li>

		<li>
			How will I join when it's time? We will send further instructions closer to the event but we
			will stream everything on all major channels.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		If you have any questions you can always <a href="email:hello@thatconference.com">email us</a>.
