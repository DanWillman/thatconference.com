		We think of ON THAT very differently. Sure it's online, aka everyone is online, but we want your
		time together to be interactive where you're the Trail Guide. Rather than big rooms of
		slide-slinging and faceless campers, we want smaller rooms with an engaging conversation
		centered around a topic. Think of it as an unconference with unlimited open space circles where
		they each have a Trail Guide. Read more about <a

		Online presents a new set of challenges where some of our traditional queues are lost. One of
		the biggest things to remember, at least for me, is giving people the acoustic space to get
		involved. It does take work to facilitate that, and no need to be in a rush; we just set the
		starting time. Here are a few other things to think about:

			<li>After five folks, everyone who joins is muted</li>
			<li>
				If you'd like to see a gallery view of folks, just open another browser window but keep your
				video and audio off.

			<li>People can raise their hands.</li>
